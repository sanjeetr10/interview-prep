1.  Find nth node from the end o a Linked List.
2.  Check Whether the given linked list is NULL-terminated or end in a cycle.
3.  Check Whether the given linked list is NULL-terminated or end in a cycle. If there is a cycle find the start node of the loop.
4.  Prove why Floyd cycle finding algorithm works.
5.  Insert a node in sorted linked list.
6.  Reverse a Singly linked list.
7.  Write the Algorithm for finding the merging point of two lined list.
8.  Find the middle of the linked list.
9.  Display linked list from end.
10. Check whether given linked list length is even or odd.
11. Given two sorted linked list, we need to merge them into the third list in sorted order.
12. Reverse a linked list in pair.
13. Sort given linked list.
14. Check if the Linked List is palindrome or not.
15. Exchange the adjacent elements in link list.
16. For a given k value (k > 0) reverse blocks of k nodes in a list.
17. Given a singly linked list L: l1 -> l2 -> l3 ... -> ln-1 -> ln. Reorder it to: l1 -> ln -> l2 -> ln-1 ....
18. Sort a linked list using insertion sort.
19. Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative, For example : given
     1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL and k = 2, return 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL.
20. You are given two linked list representing two non=negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their
    nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers ans return it as a linked list. For example:
    Input: (3 -> 4 -> 3) + (4 -> 6 -> 4)    Output: (7 -> 0 -> 8).
21. Given a linked list and a value K, partition it such that all nodes less than K comes before nodes greater than or equal to K.
    you should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions. For example :
    Given: 1->4->3->2->5->2  and K = 3, return 1->2->2->4->3->5.
22. Merge K sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
23. Given a unordered linked list, how do you remove duplicates in it?
24. Given a linked list with even and odd numbers, create an algorithm for making changes to the list in such a way
    that all even numbers appear at the beginning.
25. Given two sorted linked list, write an algorithm for printing the common elements of them.
